# NOTE: This weight is experimental (Trained quickly to finish the project as fast as possible) and may not work well on every food item + may have some false positives.
# The end goal is to have a model that can detect food items and then use mistral to get the calorie content of the detected food items.
# The final model should be able to detect even small food items such as ingredients in a dish and return the mass of the object. See: https://github.com/google-research-datasets/Nutrition5k
# WARNING: The current model is just a proof of concept.
